# TAPL Implementations

Implements (parts) of the book "Types and Programming Languages" in Rust.
So far, the following has been aded:

* untyped_arithmetic: Evaluation and parser for untyped arithmetic expressions (chapter 3 and 4)
* untyped_lambda : Evaluation and a simple parser for the untyped lambda calculus (chapters 5 and 7)
* nameless_representation : Nameless represntation of lambda terms (chapter 6)
* stlc: Type checking and evaluation, including evaluation using evaluation contexts, for the simply typed lambda calculus including extensions (chapters 9-11 (and some of chapter 19))
* inference: implements type inference (bidirectional and constraint-based) for STLC with extensions (chapter 22)
